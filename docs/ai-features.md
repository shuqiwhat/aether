# Ghost Writing

Aether's core feature is "Ghost Writing" — an AI-assisted writing experience designed to keep you in the flow.

## What is Ghost Writing?

Unlike traditional chatbots, Ghost Writing doesn't require you to stop and converse with an AI. It acts as an invisible collaborator, silently observing your context as you write and tentatively offering suggestions when you pause.

## How to Use

1.  **Start Writing**: Type in the editor as you normally would.
2.  **Pause Naturally**: When you're mid-sentence or hit enter for a new line, pause briefly.
3.  **Get Suggestions**: The AI will display a suggestion as gray "Ghost Text" based on the context.
4.  **Accept/Ignore**:
    *   Press <kbd>Tab</kbd>: **Accept** the suggestion (it becomes real text).
    *   Keep typing or press <kbd>Esc</kbd>: **Ignore** the suggestion (it disappears).

## Setting Up AI Providers

Go to `Settings` -> `Ghost Writer` to choose your AI model:

*   **OpenAI / Claude**: Requires an API Key. Provides the most powerful writing capabilities.
*   **Ollama**: Supports local models (like Llama 3, Mistral). Completely free, private, and offline.

## Best Practices

*   **Inspiration Booster**: When you're stuck, pause and see what the AI suggests. It often sparks new ideas.
*   **Quick Expansion**: List your outline points and let the AI help fill in the paragraph details.
*   **Translation & Polishing**: Write a sentence in your native language and let the AI suggest the English translation, or write a draft and let it polish the tone.
